# Proposals

Welcome to the proposals repository! This repository contains a record of all proposals given for `PMD: Shift!`.

## Overall Process

The following steps should be followed to move from your idea to an implemented ingame change:
1) Start an initial discussion of your idea on Discord
2) Identify all potential flaws, all positive points, and organize your idea
3) Ensure your Discord account is linked to your ingame account
4) Create a new issue in this repository containing your idea, including a summary and a thorough description.
5) Respond to all comments/concerns related to your proposal during the discussion period
6) Once all concerns have been addressed and the discussion period concludes, the proposal will be moved to the voting stage
7) Contributors will then vote on the proposal
8) Once approved, the proposal will start to be implemented ingame!

## Requirements for New Proposals

To create a new proposal, you must meet the following requirements:
1) 100 hours ingame
2) You can only have two active proposals at a time. Any proposals created after that point will automatically expire.
